`npm install`

1. Using a text editor, edit the `bot.js` file in the bot directory. In this file, look for the section called `Parameters to set`. These are the parameters to change:

- user
- pass
- cv_code
- size
- url
- debug
- buy

2. Run the bot

Once you've configured the bot, you can run it

`node bot.js`
